# An EEG-Based Eye Blink Detector Using Machine Learning Models #
The aim of the project is to design an EEG-based eye blink detector using machine learning models. An eye blink detector is a subset of brain-computer interface that converts blink signal into a control signal. This control signal can be used to control the devices through eye blink. Eye blink detector can be used as assistive device for the paralyzed people. The objective of this project is to design a robust machine learning model that can easily differentiate 
eye blinks and no blinks.
